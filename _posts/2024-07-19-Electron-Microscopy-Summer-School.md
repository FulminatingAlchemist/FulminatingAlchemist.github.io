Just finished an amazing Electron Microscopy Spring School at the [University of Leeds](https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-leeds/), organized by [Royal Microscopical Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/royal-microscopical-society/)! I have learned so much and met many amazing scientists. Can't wait to get back to the lab and put all these new techniques into practice. Exciting times ahead!
