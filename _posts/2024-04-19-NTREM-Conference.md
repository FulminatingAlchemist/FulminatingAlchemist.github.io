What an amazing week! I had the pleasure of attending the 26th New Trends in Research
of Energetic Materials (NTREM) conference in Pardubice, where I met leaders in the explosives industry and listened to some fascinating presentations. I can't wait for to go there again next year. Some exciting collaborations are currently on the way.
